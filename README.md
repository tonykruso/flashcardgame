# flashcardgame

Girlfriend is studying for the geologist game. I used the flashcards she has and turned it into an easy to use app.
the front is the question, by clicking (or tapping on mobile) it will flip the card to the back to show the correct response or answer. 

if you get the question correct you can X out of it to remove it, so you can focus on questions you're struggling with. below is a link to the app.
